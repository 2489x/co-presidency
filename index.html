  <h1>Co-Presidency: Two Presidents. One Nation. Decisions That Last.</h1>
  <p>A <span class="highlight">Democrat</span> and a <span class="highlight">Republican</span> governing together to establish stability, continuity, and functional leadership.</p>

  <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
  <p>Every four years, national direction changes abruptly. Large segments of the electorate are sidelined, and major policies are reversed instead of maintained or improved.</p>
  
  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <p>1. <span class="highlight">Shared Power:</span> No law, executive order, or veto happens unless both presidents agree.</p>
  <p>2. <span class="highlight">Talk in Private:</span> They discuss decisions behind closed doors so the public only sees one clear choice.</p>
  <p>3. <span class="highlight">Shared Responsibility:</span> Both leaders are equally responsible for every outcome. Success and failure are shared.</p>
  <p>A co-presidency, backed by two vice presidents, ensures when disagreements arise, both presidents must engage, deliberate, and adjust until a unified decision is produced.</p>

  <h2>TWO PRESIDENTS. ONE COUNTRY. DECISIONS BUILT TO LAST.</h2>
